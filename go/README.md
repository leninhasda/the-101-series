# go-101
Go-lang Experiments

Recently just out of curiosity ... ok not out of curiosity, but because of my colleague I had to learn Go. Well still learning. It reminds me of `C` days with it's own strange and weird way of doing things. So yeah it's kind of those love X hate situation, and I am excited to see how the journey goes.
